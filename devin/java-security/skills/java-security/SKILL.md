# Java Security Rules

trigger: writing Java or Spring code, MyBatis mappers, JSP, Thymeleaf or FreeMarker templates, application.properties or .yml; "customize java security" opens this skill's guided page. avoid: string-interpolated SQL, unescaped template output, unsafe deserialization, wildcard CORS with credentials, wildcard actuator exposure, an unverified JWT parse, a request-chosen file path, an ObjectInputStream over request bytes. Eight rules, each allow|deny|ask in .chock/security.json; absent = deny.

```
on(commit|tool_use): block(script) script=java-security-gate.py
java-security: a Java construct a rule denies -- ${} in MyBatis SQL, unescaped template output, unsafe deserialization, a wildcard CORS origin with credentials, wildcard actuator exposure, an unverified JWT parse, a request-chosen file path, an ObjectInputStream over request bytes. Each rule's verdict is allow|deny|ask in .chock/security.json (absent = deny); waive one line with // chock: allow <rule-id>; choose per rule by asking to customize java security, which opens this skill's guided page.
```

## Guided setup

Asked to customize, configure, set up, review or change these rules -- "customize java
security" and anything meaning it -- open the guided page rather than asking the questions
as prose. Open it unasked, once, when Java is about to be written and no selection file
exists at either scope: every rule denies until someone chooses, and the page is a better
first meeting than the refusal. It is `setup.html`, in this skill's own directory beside this file and
`references/`. It is offline and writes nothing itself; deny is preselected for every rule,
and a verdict is chosen, never derived from a question about the stack.

Where this client can publish an Artifact, publish that file as one, declaring
`capabilities: {db: {}}`, and let the person walk it in the panel. Their Submit writes the
result to the artifact's own store at `selection/current`; read that document back.
Everywhere else, open the page in a browser and take the result from their clipboard.

`result.selection` is the whole file and `result.wiring.scope` says where it goes:

- `repo`: `.chock/security.json` at the repository root, committed; where chock is
  installed there, `chock sync --repo .` afterwards.
- `user`: `~/.chock/security.json`, the floor for work outside a repository that carries its
  own. A repository carrying `.chock/security.json` governs itself: refuse the user-scope
  write, say so, and offer to change the committed file in a pull request.

Show the person one row per rule before writing, and overwrite an existing selection only
after they have seen the diff. Never write a pattern, severity or path into the file: it
carries verdicts only, and the gate refuses anything else at the next write. Reach for the
text walk -- `references/setup-contract.json`, one rule at a time, deny unless told
otherwise -- only where the page cannot be shown at all.

Wiring is not this skill's. Installed as a plugin, the hooks beside this file judge each
write and the turn's end; in a repository, `chock sync` adds the commit hook. Both read the
same selection file.

This policy is enforced in this client by the Stop hook installed with the plugin: the write itself is not judged here, because the client records no write-tool vocabulary, and what the turn left on disk is judged at its end instead. Subject to the fail conditions stated in the plugin description. Repo-wide enforcement across every commit and in CI still needs `chock sync`. See https://github.com/open-coder-ai/chock
