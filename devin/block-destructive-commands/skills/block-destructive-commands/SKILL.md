# Block Destructive Commands

Best-effort guard against destructive commands: rm -rf targeting absolute, home ($HOME/~) or root-adjacent paths (and the PowerShell Remove-Item -Recurse equivalent); git push --force (not --force-with-lease); git reset --hard; git clean -f; kubectl delete; terraform destroy; aws s3 rm --recursive / rb --force; dropdb; helm uninstall/delete; docker volume rm/prune and system prune; gcloud ... delete; find -delete / -exec rm; shred; truncate; wipefs -a. Destructive verbs are matched position-aware, so a bucket, path or object NAMED like a verb (helm list delete) is allowed, and find/shred/truncate apply the same target test as rm, so a relative path in the working tree stays allowed. sudo, doas and pkexec are transparent wrappers: the program they run is graded, escalation itself is not refused. Known bypasses: aliases, quoted arguments, non-standard clients, an unusual value-flag outside the curated set, and indirect invocation via a script or interpreter. This is friction, not a security boundary.

This policy ships a PreToolUse hook in this plugin's hooks.json, best-effort in Devin: fail-open by the vendor's own design, subject to the fail conditions stated in the plugin description. Repo-wide git-hook and CI coverage still needs `chock sync`. See https://github.com/open-coder-ai/chock
