# rtk Dangerous Actions Blocker

Carved out for rtk-ai/rtk#1007: rtk's own decision table as a chock policy (rtk's own hooks may not block). Refuses rm -rf on root, home, parent or absolute paths; git push --force and '+' refspecs (not --force-with-lease); reads of credential files (.env, *.pem, *.key, id_rsa, ~/.ssh, ~/.aws) and echoes or inline literals of *_API_KEY/*_SECRET/*_TOKEN; DROP/TRUNCATE/unscoped DELETE through psql, mysql, sqlite3, mongosh, redis-cli, and dropdb; plus the base policy's cloud rows (kubectl delete, terraform destroy, aws s3 rm --recursive, helm uninstall, gcloud delete, docker volume rm). Asks where rtk's table says ask: rm -rf on a relative path off the safe list; git reset --hard, clean -f, checkout ., branch -D; docker prune and docker rm -f over a substitution. File checks are skipped inside docker/kubectl exec, as rtk specifies; rtk is a transparent prefix. Bypasses: aliases, quoting, indirection, sourced files, interpreters, indirect scripts. This is friction, not a security boundary.

This policy ships a PreToolUse hook in this plugin's hooks.json, best-effort in Devin: fail-open by the vendor's own design, subject to the fail conditions stated in the plugin description. Repo-wide git-hook and CI coverage still needs `chock sync`. See https://github.com/open-coder-ai/chock
