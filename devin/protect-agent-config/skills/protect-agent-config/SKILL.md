# Protect Agent Config

Guard against an agent hand-editing its own guardrails. Agent instruction files (AGENTS.md and the per-agent wrappers), permission files (.claude/settings.json, .mcp.json) and vendored enforcement (.chock/bin/, .chock/compiled/) define what the agent may do -- so a shell command that rewrites them is the agent modifying its own authority (MITRE ATLAS AML.T0081). The guard refuses shell write-commands targeting those paths; reads pass, and regeneration through `chock sync` passes because the tool writes them itself. Best-effort and deliberately coarse: a write signal (a `>`/`>>` redirect, or a writer verb like rm/cp/sed -i) is scoped to its own clause of the command line, so it must actually target the protected path, not merely appear alongside it; a glued-on separator or a non-redirect writer's own operand are not resolved that finely. The 'chock: approved-config-change' marker is friction plus an audit trail, not authentication; the check an agent cannot self-approve is the commit-time gate and CI.

This policy ships a PreToolUse hook in this plugin's hooks.json, best-effort in Devin: fail-open by the vendor's own design, subject to the fail conditions stated in the plugin description. Repo-wide git-hook and CI coverage still needs `chock sync`. See https://github.com/open-coder-ai/chock
