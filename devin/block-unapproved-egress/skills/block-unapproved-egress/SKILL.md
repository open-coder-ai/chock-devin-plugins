# Block Unapproved Egress

Best-effort guard against exfiltration through the tool channel: a network command (curl/wget/Invoke-WebRequest) that UPLOADS data -- POST/PUT, --data/--form, --upload-file, --post-file -- to a host outside the egress allowlist. The allowlist defaults to package registries and code hosting and is meant to be extended with your org's own domains; a host matches by exact name or ".<entry>" suffix. Fetch-only traffic is left alone -- the target is upload to an unapproved host, not normal dependency traffic. A schemeless or protocol-relative target is checked too, from the last non-flag token, but only when no explicit http(s):// URL appears anywhere -- once one has, it alone decides. Tool-time FLOOR, not a network sandbox: it stops the obvious reflex, not a determined adversary. Known bypasses: ~/.curlrc, combined short flags, obfuscated payloads, non-standard clients, a language runtime. Escape: 'pragma: allowlist egress'.

```

This policy ships a PreToolUse hook in this plugin's hooks.json, best-effort in Devin: fail-open by the vendor's own design, subject to the fail conditions stated in the plugin description. Repo-wide git-hook and CI coverage still needs `chock sync`. See https://github.com/open-coder-ai/chock
